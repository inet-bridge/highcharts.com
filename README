I-Net Bridge:

The forked versions are in branches prefixed with inet_, such as inet_highstock_v1.2.5.
Building a new fork:
1. Check out the tag of the release you wish to fork.
2. Switch to a new branch, eg. inet_highstock_v1.3.2.
3. Check which current patches are still necessary. Apply them as separate commits.
4. Add any new patches. Make sure to commit each patch separately, so they are easy to apply selectively next time.
5. Run `ant dist` from the command line to build the new Highcharts version. (Ant is a Java library, cf. http://ant.apache.org)
